Task 1 — Policy Dataset Exploration and Vectorization

Submodule: task_1/ — Policy dataset preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and exploratory NLP analysis.

This module represents the first stage of the internship project, focused on preparing and analyzing public policy datasets. It covers data preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and early-stage NLP exploration, laying the foundation for building intelligent policy navigation systems.

Key Features

Dataset Preparation — Includes raw, training, and test CSV files for policy data.

TF-IDF Vectorization — Converts policy text into numerical features for ML/NLP tasks.

Pretrained Vectorizer — policy_vectorizer.pkl ensures consistent text preprocessing.

TF-IDF Matrix — Precomputed policy_tfidf_matrix.pkl for faster experimentation.

Exploratory Notebook — infosys_nlp.ipynb demonstrates preprocessing and analysis flow.
